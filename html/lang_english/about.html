                This is a remote desktop control program based on Windows platform.<br />
                It not only provides remote control, but also supports video cameras, multi-channel audio, <br />push stream, and multimedia entertainment functions such as watching videos and playing games on a remote desktop.<br />
                And provide a transit server program to solve the remote desktop problem of accessing the intranet.<br />
                The control end supports Windows series (including WINXP, WIN7, WIN8, WIN10).<br />
                The control side supports native clients, and also supports web clients.<br />
                Web client-supported browsers include Chrome, FireFox, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera and other modern browsers.<br />
                IE and IE kernel browser are not supported. Web client is open platform, almost all operating system platforms support (including mobile platforms and PC platforms).<br />
                Network transmission not only supports unencrypted plaintext transmission, but also supports SSL encrypted transmission, providing security for data transmission.<br />
                <br />
                The software does not link to a fixed server, nor does it provide automatic update. If there is any need, please send me an email.<br />

                This software includes two programs (and two configuration files), xdisp_virt.exeºÍxdisp_server.exe¡£<br />
                Xdisp_virt implements the core remote desktop functions, and native or web clients can connect directly to this program, <br />
                        which can also connect to the xdisp_server transit server.<br />
                Xdisp_server implements the network transfer service, runs xdisp_server on the public network server, <br />
                        and xdisp_virt on the intranet connects to xdisp_server on the public network.<br />
                A native or web client can connect to xdisp_server to get all the xdisp_virt lists, so you can choose one to establish remote control.<br />
                <br />
                Software uses GDI, DXGI or Mirror driver technology to capture desktop image data from Windows, <br />
                        and WASAPI technology to capture the internal sound of the computer, and then uses various coding algorithms.<br />
                The audio and image coding compression, defined as a private transport protocol, is transmitted over the network to the native or web client.<br />
                Web client uses WebSocket network transmission to get the encoded image and voice, and then through JavaScript decoding,<br />
                         and then draw on the page, the voice played out through the web page.<br />
                 Specific principles can be described in the Windows series on CSDN for remote desktop articles.
